// Write a function, gooseFilter/goose_filter/GooseFilter,
// that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a filtered array containing the same elements but with the 'geese' removed.
// The geese are any strings in the following array, which is pre-populated in your solution:
// geese = ["African", "Roman Tufted", "Toulouse", "Pilgrim", "Steinbacher"]

function gooseFilter(birds) {
  const geese = ["African", "Roman Tufted", "Toulouse", "Pilgrim", "Steinbacher"];
  return birds.filter(bird => !geese.includes(bird));
